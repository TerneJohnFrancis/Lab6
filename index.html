<h2>Battleships</h2>
<p>The main firepower of a naval squadron; these giants have the thickest armor, biggest guns, and considerably long range. High durability allows them to absorb a huge amount of damage, while the big guns allow them to obliterate any opponent with a few well- aimed salvos</p>
<br><p><center>Below are the most powerful battleships of the Pacific Theather of War:</center></p>
<ul>
    <li>USS Iowa; BB-61</li>

<h2>Fleet Carriers</h2>
<p>The might of a fast-attack group, fleet carriers are unique in their ability to see other ships without being spotted themselves. As a result, their reliance on deck-based aircraft is both their strength and weakness. But when combined with highly effective tactics, fleet carriers become the most devastating ships in the battle group</p>
<br><p><center>Shown below are the most prominent fleet carriers in the Pacific Theather of War:</center></p>
<ul>
    <li>USS Yorktown; CV-5</li>

<h2>Heavy Cruisers</h2>
<p>The vanguard of the battle fleet, heavy cruisers are lighter than battleships but more heavily armored than fleet carriers. Their speed is comparable to that of destroyers, while their anti- aircraft batteries are nearly unmatched in strength and numbers. This gives the heavy cruisers an important position in the fleet, functioning as a movable anti-aircraft shield.</p>
<br><p><center>Shown here are two notable heavy cruisers from the American and Japanese navies:</center></p>
    <li>USS San Francisco; CA-38</li>
